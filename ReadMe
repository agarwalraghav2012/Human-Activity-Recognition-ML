UsingStatistical.py performs statistical feature reduction.
All features with title containing 'mean' or 'std' are selected for final Xtrain.
Then, different ML models are applied to the obtained data.
Uncommenting any model for clf variable will instantiate that model.
Only one model must be uncommented at a time, else the latter model shall be implemented.

UsingPCA.py performs PCA reduction.
The data is reduced to 15 features.
The double '##' commented part generates the graphs when uncommented.
Then, different ML models are applied to the obtained data.
Uncommenting any model for clf variable will instantiate that model.
Only one model must be uncommented at a time, else the latter model shall be implemented.
